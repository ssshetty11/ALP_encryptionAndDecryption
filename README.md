# ALP_encryptionAndDecryption
The "Assembly Language Message Encryption and Decryption" project is a simple demonstration of message encryption and decryption using assembly language. It provides a basic example of how messages can be secured through encryption and then decrypted using a specified key.

In this project, we have implemented a message encryption algorithm in assembly language. The user provides a message and an encryption key, and the program performs encryption on the message. The encrypted message can then be decrypted using the same key.
